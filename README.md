# Hi there, I'm Francisco Pinto <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="29px" height="29px">

:eyes: Here you can see some of the **projects developed by me** and others **together with other colleagues**.   
:computer: These projects range from **university projects** to **didactic projects** in order to understand and satisfy curiosity in some of the themes such as ciphers, games, network projects, being these developed in different languages.

## About Me :raising_hand_man: 

:necktie: I'm a backend developer working with microsservices.   
:hammer: Some of the technologies I work on daily are C#, .NET, SQL, Docker.   
:books: Right now, I'm interested in developing my knowledge of Kubernetes. I finished my masters degree by doing a dissertation about deployment strategies in Kubernetes in microservices architectures and I'm developing my knowledge through a series of courses to prepare me for the CKAD exam.
